~ a data + ML project

it aims to cover the following:

### mvp

    - clean and prep shot data
    - visualize basic hot zones
    - build a basic shot success model (Logistic Regression or Random Forest)
    - share visuals and code cleanly (GitHub repo, notebooks)

### more depth

once MVP is done:

    - add features like:
    - Shot angle, quarter, time left
    - Player ID (group patterns)
    - Tune model, try XGBoost
    - Add interactivity to visuals (e.g., with Tableau or Streamlit)

### exploratory

if i have time:

    - context features (e.g., dribbles, defender distance)
    - deep learning (like using player movement)
    - animate shot charts (motion link)
    - dashboards or story presentations
